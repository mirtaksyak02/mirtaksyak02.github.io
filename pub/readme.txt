This file is in a top level directory for FTP mirtaksyak02's.
If you are having trouble figuring out what to do, or how to find an
information you are interested, you should probably read this file more detail.

You can also read the SEARCH.TXT file in this directory (or one
level up) for an explanation of file names, a listing of all files,
and instructions for finding them.  Here is an short overview:

In directory "Useful Files" contains various files that can help you run the game on modern systems or optimize its performance. Directories in him contain:

        game name (release) - example
        test01 test02 test03 test04 test05 test06 test07 test08 test09
        test10 test11 test12 test13 test14 test15 test16 test17 test18

Note that many of these directories are quite full (?).

Starting with directory "Games #00001", all files are arranged by year number,
with a unique subdirectory based on that year number (starting with
numbers 1980-2022).  To get to the files for a particular game, you need to
"drill down" a few subdirectory levels.  For example, game #00013 is in
this subdirectory: 
        1980/13

while game #09274 is in this subdirectory:
	2014/09274

In end of 2022, a project was started to categorize folders and files within them.. This means that the best way to find the files is to use the database tool at:
http://mirtaksyak02.github.io/pub/FAQ.TXT or http://mirtaksyak02.github.io/pub/SEARCH.TXT.
